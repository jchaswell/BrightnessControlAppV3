# BrightnessControlAppV3

Why I built this

    1 - to test how much I can build with very limited scripting knowledge, using GPT4 to do almost all the heavy lifting.
    2 - I wanted this functionality and didn't like the current options out there

Why you should use it (or ClickMonitor, or Monitorian...actually probably one of those and not mine lol)

    Sleep is the #1 most important thing for health and 10xing life
    Controlling the type and amount of light entering your eyes is the #1 way to affect sleep

    Your eyes should not be getting blasted by a giant LED screen on full brightness right before going to bed.  

    Definitely use an app to drastically reduce the blue light coming from your monitors at night (I like flux), but even non-blue light can interfere with your circadian.

    So, set some scheduled brightness changes in this app, it should be very low by the end of the night near bedtime.

    Also recommend using auto-dimming lights, I use the philips smart lights.
  
How to use it

    Click add event at the bottom, set the desired brightness and time of day.  
    I recommend at least 3-5 changes, so no single change is too drastic for your eyes to quickly adjust to.  
    Yes i could have added slow fading, but I didn't.
    The bar at the top is for manual overrides.  If you leave the checkbox unchecked, it will override it only until the next scheduled change.
